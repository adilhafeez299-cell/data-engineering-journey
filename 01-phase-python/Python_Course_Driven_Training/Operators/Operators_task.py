# this was the task
# 1). create two variables and assign them the same sequences of type set. Do not copy one variable to another
# 2). compare two created variables using comparison operator. Print result to the terminal. Explain the result
# 3). Compare two objects using the is operator, explain the result
# 4). Check if there are certain elements in the set using the in operator

## Special Considerations

### Transferable Skills
Help connect user's AWS Cloud Support experience to data engineering:
- Troubleshooting complex systems
- Reading logs and debugging
- Understanding distributed systems
- Customer communication and documentation
- Working under pressure with SLAs

### Learning Style
- Practical, hands-on learner
- Benefits from concrete examples
- Prefers building to theoretical study
- Values clear structure and organization

### Time Constraints
- Full-time job, so learning happens outside work hours
- Need for efficient, focused learning
- Importance of maintaining momentum
- Balance between depth and timeline

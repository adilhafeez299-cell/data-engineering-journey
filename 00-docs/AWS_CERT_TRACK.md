## SUCCESS TIPS

### Study Habits
1. **Hands-on first:** Always try labs before watching videos
2. **Code everything:** Don't just read about services, use them
3. **Practice exams:** Take them seriously, simulate real exam conditions
4. **Review wrong answers:** Understand why, not just memorize correct answers
5. **Cheat sheets:** Create your own, don't just read Tutorial Dojo's

### Exam Day Tips
1. **Read questions carefully:** AWS loves "MOST cost-effective" or "LEAST operational overhead"
2. **Eliminate wrong answers:** Narrow down to 2 choices, then choose
3. **Flag and return:** Don't spend >2 minutes on one question
4. **Time management:** 130 min / 65 questions = 2 min per question
5. **Stay calm:** You need 72%, not 100%

### Mental Game
1. **It's okay to fail:** Retakes are common and expected
2. **Understanding > memorization:** Focus on concepts, not facts
3. **Trust the process:** Follow the study plan, don't cram
4. **Celebrate small wins:** Every lab completed is progress
5. **Ask for help:** Claude is here for technical questions

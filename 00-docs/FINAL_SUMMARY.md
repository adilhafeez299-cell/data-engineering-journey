## WHAT'S ACCURATE (VERIFIED)

✅ Your job: Systems Engineer at MSP (£35k)
✅ Your gym schedule: 5-6 days/week (non-negotiable)
✅ Your work hours: 9 AM-6 PM
✅ Your available study time: 10-13 hours/week (weekends primarily)
✅ **REVISED GOAL:** Junior SWE/Platform Engineer by Jan 2026 (£38k-£50k), then Data Engineer by mid-2027 (£60k-£75k)
✅ Your learning resources:
  - Bogdan Python Course (O'Reilly)
  - On-the-job learning (40hrs/week, Jan 2026 onwards)
  - Weekend supplements: SQL, cloud, data tools (2026-2027)
✅ **REVISED TIMELINE:** 18-24 months (Nov 2025 → Jul 2027)
✅ Your dual-track strategy: Job search (Junior SWE/Platform Engineer) + Learning in parallel
✅ **REVISED CERTIFICATIONS:** 1-2 targeted (not 3 rushed)
  - AWS Certified Developer/Solutions Architect (during job, 2026)
  - Optional: Databricks Associate (if time permits, 2027)

**Philosophy Update:**
Better to spend 18-24 months becoming a STRONG engineer, then specialize in data, than to rush into 'Data Engineer' title in 9 months with shallow foundation.

## WHAT'S REMOVED (OLD PLANS)

❌ All previous roadmap versions (god_map.pdf, V1, V2, V3, etc.)  
❌ Multiple conflicting week-by-week plans  
❌ Project lists with fabricated course details  
❌ Overlapping or contradictory timelines  

**These five documents ARE your only source of truth going forward.**

**Read:** WEEK_BY_WEEK_EXECUTION - Week 3 section (detailed breakdown)

---

## YOUR DECISION POINTS

### "Should I follow the master plan or week-by-week guide?"
**Both.** Master Plan = strategic vision. Week-by-Week = tactical execution.
- Master Plan: Monthly review
- Week-by-Week: Daily execution

### "What if something in the plan doesn't work for me?"
**Tell me immediately. We'll adjust intelligently.**
- Life happens → We adapt
- Behind schedule → We extend timeline
- Concept not sticking → We slow down or change resource
- Just communicate it in your weekly check-in

### "Should I do the optional resources?"
**No.** Stick to what's required:
- Bogdan Python (required)
- Mode Analytics SQL (required)
- Databricks Academy (required)
- AWS official materials (required)
- Everything else: Only if you have extra time (you won't)

### "What if I fail a certification exam?"
**Don't panic.** You have 2-week retake buffers built in. Most people pass on 2nd try.
- Review weak areas
- Study 1 more week
- Retake and pass
- Timeline extends by 1-2 weeks (acceptable)

### "What if I don't get a stepping-stone job offer?"
**Also okay.** Plan accommodates both:
- Scenario A: You get offer, settle in, learn better
- Scenario B: You stay at MSP, maintain minimum job search, focus on certifications
- Either way: You're ready for Data Engineer search by May 2026

## WHAT DETERMINES YOUR SUCCESS

### ✅ YOU CONTROL
- Showing up every weekend consistently
- Coding every example yourself (no shortcuts)
- Completing projects (working > perfect)
- Being honest in check-ins
- Asking for help when stuck
- Adjusting intelligently when needed
- Maintaining gym schedule (mental health)

### ⚠️ YOU INFLUENCE
- How quickly you grasp concepts
- How many job applications succeed
- How many interviews you get
- Whether you pass certs on first try

### ❌ YOU DON'T CONTROL
- The job market
- Company hiring decisions
- Whether life disrupts your plan
- Perfect execution of timeline

**Success = your control + influence + acceptance of uncertainty**

---

## HONEST TALK

### This IS achievable
- 9 months is enough time
- You have the right resources
- Your schedule is realistic
- Thousands have done similar transitions

### This ISN'T easy
- You'll hit hard weeks (especially cert sprints)
- Some concepts won't click immediately (that's normal)
- Job search rejection is real
- You might fail a cert exam (retry is planned)

### This REQUIRES consistency
- Show up every weekend for 26 weeks
- Code everything yourself (no shortcuts)
- Be honest about progress
- Adjust intelligently but don't abandon

### You've GOT this
Because:
- You've committed to the gym 5-6 days/week (discipline proven)
- You created multiple detailed roadmaps (commitment shown)
- You're asking for accountability (self-awareness)
- You're willing to be honest about needing structure (humility)

- **One support system** (weekly check-ins with me)

You don't need to overthink it.  
You don't need new plans.  
You don't need more resources.  

You just need to **execute consistently for 26 weeks.**

One weekend at a time.  
One week at a time.  
One certification at a time.  
One project at a time.  

By July 2026, you'll be interviewing for Data Engineer roles at £75k-£85k.

Let's build it.

---

## YOUR DECISION POINTS

### "Should I follow the master plan or week-by-week guide?"
**Both.** Master Plan = strategic vision. Week-by-Week = tactical execution.
- Master Plan: Monthly review
- Week-by-Week: Daily execution

### "What if something in the plan doesn't work for me?"
**Tell me immediately. We'll adjust intelligently.**
- Life happens → We adapt
- Behind schedule → We extend timeline
- Concept not sticking → We slow down or change resource
- Just communicate it in your weekly check-in

### "Should I do the optional resources?"
**No.** Stick to what's required:
- Bogdan Python (required)
- Mode Analytics SQL (required)
- Databricks Academy (required)
- AWS official materials (required)
- Everything else: Only if you have extra time (you won't)

### "What if I fail a certification exam?"
**Don't panic.** You have 2-week retake buffers built in. Most people pass on 2nd try.
- Review weak areas
- Study 1 more week
- Retake and pass
- Timeline extends by 1-2 weeks (acceptable)

### "What if I don't get a stepping-stone job offer?"
**Also okay.** Plan accommodates both:
- Scenario A: You get offer, settle in, learn better
- Scenario B: You stay at MSP, maintain minimum job search, focus on certifications
- Either way: You're ready for Data Engineer search by May 2026

## YOUR TIMELINE AT A GLANCE (REVISED DECEMBER 2025)

**Learning Track (Continues as Planned):**
```
Nov 2025: Python Foundations (4 weeks)
├─ W1: ✅ Complete (25%)
├─ W2: 📍 In Progress (target 50%)
├─ W3: Project 1 planning
└─ W4: Project 1 complete + recovery week

Dec 2025 onwards: Continue learning progression
├─ SQL & Data Analysis
├─ AWS & Cloud
├─ Databricks + Capstone
└─ All 6 projects + 3 certifications
```

**Job Search Track (Updated Strategy):**
```
Nov - Dec 2025: Junior SWE/Platform Engineer Search
├─ W2-3: Applications + networking (targeting engineering roles)
├─ W4-6: Follow-ups + interviews
└─ Target: Engineering role offer by Jan 2026

**SCENARIO A: Junior SWE/Platform Role (Preferred)**
Jan 2026 - Mid 2027: Engineering Role + Parallel DE Learning
├─ Work: 40 hrs/week engineering (paid learning)
├─ Study: 10-13 hrs/week weekends (DE focus - same as original plan)
├─ Complete: All 6 projects + 3 certs by mid-2026 (less rushed)
├─ Build: Dual expertise (engineering + data engineering)
└─ Result: Strong foundation with professional experience

Mid-2027: Data Engineer Search
├─ Portfolio: 1-2 years engineering + 3 certs + 6 projects
├─ Positioning: "Strong engineer who specializes in data"
└─ Target: £75k-£85k Data Engineer role

**SCENARIO B: Cloud Support or Stay at MSP**
Jan 2026 - July 2026: Execute Core Plan
├─ Study: 10-13 hrs/week (same as current)
├─ Complete: All 6 projects + 3 certs
└─ Launch: DE search July 2026 (£75k-£85k target)
```

**Updated Philosophy:**
> Better job target (Junior SWE/Platform) + extended timeline (18-24 months) = SAME learning goals with less pressure and professional mentorship.
>
> More time ≠ Fewer goals. More time = Same goals executed better with real-world experience.

## WHAT DETERMINES YOUR SUCCESS

### ✅ YOU CONTROL
- Showing up every weekend consistently
- Coding every example yourself (no shortcuts)
- Completing projects (working > perfect)
- Being honest in check-ins
- Asking for help when stuck
- Adjusting intelligently when needed
- Maintaining gym schedule (mental health)

### ⚠️ YOU INFLUENCE
- How quickly you grasp concepts
- How many job applications succeed
- How many interviews you get
- Whether you pass certs on first try

### ❌ YOU DON'T CONTROL
- The job market
- Company hiring decisions
- Whether life disrupts your plan
- Perfect execution of timeline

**Success = your control + influence + acceptance of uncertainty**

---

## HONEST TALK

### This IS achievable
- 9 months is enough time
- You have the right resources
- Your schedule is realistic
- Thousands have done similar transitions

### This ISN'T easy
- You'll hit hard weeks (especially cert sprints)
- Some concepts won't click immediately (that's normal)
- Job search rejection is real
- You might fail a cert exam (retry is planned)

### This REQUIRES consistency
- Show up every weekend for 26 weeks
- Code everything yourself (no shortcuts)
- Be honest about progress
- Adjust intelligently but don't abandon

### You've GOT this
Because:
- You've committed to the gym 5-6 days/week (discipline proven)
- You created multiple detailed roadmaps (commitment shown)
- You're asking for accountability (self-awareness)
- You're willing to be honest about needing structure (humility)

- **One execution guide** (day-by-day for 26 weeks)
- **One project library** (specifications for all 6 projects)
- **One support system** (weekly check-ins with me)

You don't need to overthink it.  
You don't need new plans.  
You don't need more resources.  

You just need to **execute consistently for 26 weeks.**

One weekend at a time.  
One week at a time.  
One certification at a time.  
One project at a time.  

By July 2026, you'll be interviewing for Data Engineer roles at £75k-£85k.

Let's build it.

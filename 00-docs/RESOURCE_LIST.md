## RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TIPS

### What NOT to Do
1. **Don't hoard resources:** Only access current phase resources
2. **Don't buy courses on impulse:** Stick to the plan
3. **Don't collect YouTube playlists:** Focus on verified core resources
4. **Don't start new courses mid-phase:** Finish what you started
5. **Don't pay full price:** Always wait for Udemy sales

### What TO Do
1. **Bookmark only current phase resources:** Reduce decision fatigue
2. **Complete before moving on:** 100% core resources before supplementary
3. **Take notes actively:** Summarize in your own words
4. **Build projects:** Apply learning immediately
5. **Ask for help:** Use Claude for clarification when stuck >30 min

### Quality Signals for Resources
✅ **Use if:**
- Official documentation (AWS, Databricks, PostgreSQL)
- Verified course platform (O'Reilly, Udemy, Databricks Academy)
- High ratings + recent reviews (Udemy courses 4.5+ stars)
- Free and reputable (Mode Analytics, LeetCode, Kaggle)

## THE SEVEN DOCUMENTS (3 Core + 4 Reference)

You now have seven complete, accurate, non-fabricated documents:

### Core 1. **MASTER_PLAN_v1_AUTHORITATIVE.md**
**Your strategic roadmap. Read this once, reference always.**

**UPDATED DECEMBER 2025:**
- Complete overview of your 18-24 month transition (Nov 2025 → Jul 2027)
- 3 phases explained:
  - Phase 1: Engineering Fundamentals + Job Applications (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026)
  - Phase 2: On-the-Job Learning + Weekend Supplements (Jan 2026 - Jul 2027)
  - Phase 3: Data Engineer Transition (Mid-2027)
- Dual-track strategy (job search + learning) clearly laid out
- Target: Junior SWE/Platform Engineer by Jan 2026, Data Engineer by Jul 2027
- Certifications: 1-2 targeted (not 3 rushed)
- Projects: 3-4 quality builds (not 6 rushed)
- Contingency plans for when life happens
- Your non-negotiable commitment

**When to use:**

## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### Daily Workflow
1. **Monday morning:** Check the week-by-week guide for this week
2. **Every day:** Follow the day-by-day breakdown
3. **When stuck:** Message Claude (me) with specific blockers
4. **Sunday evening:** Use the check-in template to report

### Weekly Workflow
```
Sunday Evening (30 min):
├─ Review week's accomplishments ✅
├─ Fill out check-in template
├─ Message Claude with progress
├─ Read next week's plan
└─ Celebrate wins 🎉

Monday Morning (5 min):
└─ Skim this week's plan
```

### Monthly Workflow
1. **First Sunday of month:** Monthly review
   - Did I hit targets? (Yes/No/Close)
   - What worked well?
   - What needs adjusting?
   - Should I modify next month's plan?

2. **Reference Master Plan:**
   - Check that month's deliverables
   - Make sure you're on track
   - Adjust if needed (with reason)

### When Behind Schedule
**Don't panic. Reference MASTER_PLAN contingency section:**

- 1-2 weeks behind? → Add 2-3 hrs to next 2 weekends
- 3+ weeks behind? → Extend current phase by 1-2 weeks
- Exam failed? → Use 2-week retake buffer
- Burnout? → Take full week off, resume at 50%

## YOUR REALITY CHECK (UPDATED DECEMBER 2025)

### What's Real About This Plan
✅ Your current job (MSP, £35k)
✅ Your gym schedule (5-6 days/week—non-negotiable)
✅ Your work hours (9-6 PM)
✅ Your weekend availability (4-5 hours Sat, 4-5 hours Sun)
✅ **REVISED GOAL:** Junior SWE/Platform Engineer by Jan 2026 (£38k-£50k), then Data Engineer by mid-2027 (£60k-£75k)
✅ Your dual-track strategy (job search + learning parallel)
✅ Your learning resources (Bogdan Python, then on-the-job learning)
✅ Your certifications (1-2 targeted, not 3 rushed)
✅ **REVISED TIMELINE:** 18-24 months (Nov 2025 → Jul 2027), more sustainable  

### What's Uncertain (But Planned For)
⚠️ Will you get Junior SWE/Platform Engineer offer by Jan 2026? (Realistic, but not guaranteed)
⚠️ Will you get Data Engineer offer by Jul 2027? (Much more likely with 18-24mo experience)
⚠️ Will you pass certs on first try? (Retake buffers built in)
⚠️ What if life happens? (Contingency plans included, timeline is flexible)  

### What Will Determine Success
1. **Consistency** (showing up every weekend, Nov 2025 - Jan 2026)
2. **Securing engineering role** (Junior SWE/Platform Engineer by Jan 2026)
3. **On-the-job learning** (applying yourself fully in new role, 40hrs/week)
4. **Weekend supplements** (5-8hrs/week data skills, 2026-2027)
5. **Patience** (18-24 months to build strong foundation, not rushing)
6. **Flexibility** (adjusting intelligently when needed)

## WHAT NOT TO DO

### ❌ DON'T
- Read all weeks at once (focus on current week only)
- Add new courses mid-phase (breaks focus)
- Skip recovery weeks (they're part of the strategy)
- Copy-paste code from tutorials (defeats the purpose)
- Polish projects endlessly (working > perfect)
- Expect to work weeknights + weekends (you'll burn out)
- Ignore the check-in template (accountability matters)
- **Apply to Cloud Support roles if you can get engineering roles** (lateral move vs. career growth)
- **Apply to Data Engineer jobs before mid-2027** (need 18-24mo engineering experience first)
- **Rush the timeline** (9-month sprint was too aggressive, 18-24mo is sustainable)

### ✅ DO
- Read only your current week (Weeks 1-8 focus now)
- Code everything yourself (no copy-paste)
- Complete Project 1 by Jan 2026
- Apply to Junior SWE/Platform Engineer roles (5-10 quality applications)
- Take recovery weeks seriously
- Report honestly on Friday evenings
- Ask for help when stuck >30 minutes
- **Prioritize engineering roles over support roles** (career trajectory matters)
- **Be patient with 18-24 month timeline** (sustainable > rushed)
- Trust the process
- Show up consistently

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### "Should I follow MASTER_PLAN or WEEK_BY_WEEK?"
**Both. Master Plan is strategic, Week-by-Week is tactical.**
- Use Master Plan for monthly reviews and understanding the big picture
- Use Week-by-Week for daily/weekly execution
- They work together

### "What if the week-by-week plan doesn't match my life?"
**Adjust intelligently, then tell me.**
- If you have a doctor's appointment Saturday? → Move 2 hours to Sunday
- If you're sick? → Take the week lighter, adjust timeline
- If work is crazy? → Reduce to weekends only temporarily
- Just report the adjustment so I can help replanning

### "Should I do all the optional resources?"
**No. Stick to the primary ones:**
- Bogdan Python (required)
- Mode Analytics SQL (required)
- Databricks Academy (required)
- AWS official prep (required)
- Everything else: Only if time permits, don't let it slow primary work

### "What if I'm behind on a project?"
**Don't panic. You have flexibility:**
1. Extend that phase by 1-2 weeks (you have buffer)
2. Reduce project scope (focus on MVP, not perfection)
3. Continue to next phase (don't let one project block progress)
4. Tell me so we can adjust the overall timeline if needed

### "How do I know if I'm on track?"
**Check these milestones:**
- Week 4 (Dec 1): Bogdan 70%, Project 1 done
- Week 8 (Jan 5): Phase 1 + 2 complete, Project 2 done
- Week 13 (Feb 9): SQL Mastery complete + Project 2 progress
- Week 22 (Apr 19): AWS cert + Projects 4-5
- Week 26 (May 18): Capstone started, job search launched
- Week 36 (Jul 28): Capstone done, job search active

If you're at 80%+ of targets, you're on track. If <60%, let's adjust.

## YOUR COMMITMENT (REVISED DECEMBER 2025)

By using these seven documents consistently for 18-24 months, you will:

✅ **By Jan 2026:** Secure Junior SWE/Platform Engineer role (£38k-£50k)
✅ **Jan 2026-Jul 2027:** Learn engineering properly on the job (40hrs/week paid learning)
✅ **Weekends 2026-2027:** Build data-specific skills (SQL, cloud, data tools - still 10-13 hrs/week)
✅ **Mid-2027:** Position yourself for Data Engineer roles with REAL experience
✅ **Portfolio:** All 6 projects + 3 certifications (completed over 18-24 months, less rushed)
✅ **Outcome:** Strong chance at £75k-£85k Data Engineer offer by mid-2027

**This is not guaranteed.** Life happens, markets change, luck plays a role.

**But this approach is MORE sustainable and MORE likely to succeed than the 9-month sprint.**

Why? You're building **genuine competence** with **professional mentorship**, not just weekend self-study.

And the skills you build? They're **yours forever.**

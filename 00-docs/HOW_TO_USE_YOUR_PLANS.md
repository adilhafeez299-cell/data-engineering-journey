## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### Daily Workflow
1. **Monday morning:** Check the week-by-week guide for this week
2. **Every day:** Follow the day-by-day breakdown
3. **When stuck:** Message Claude (me) with specific blockers
4. **Sunday evening:** Use the check-in template to report

### Weekly Workflow
```
Sunday Evening (30 min):
├─ Review week's accomplishments ✅
├─ Fill out check-in template
├─ Message Claude with progress
├─ Read next week's plan
└─ Celebrate wins 🎉

Monday Morning (5 min):
└─ Skim this week's plan
```

### Monthly Workflow
1. **First Sunday of month:** Monthly review
   - Did I hit targets? (Yes/No/Close)
   - What worked well?
   - What needs adjusting?
   - Should I modify next month's plan?

2. **Reference Master Plan:**
   - Check that month's deliverables
   - Make sure you're on track
   - Adjust if needed (with reason)

### When Behind Schedule
**Don't panic. Reference MASTER_PLAN contingency section:**

- 1-2 weeks behind? → Add 2-3 hrs to next 2 weekends
- 3+ weeks behind? → Extend current phase by 1-2 weeks
- Exam failed? → Use 2-week retake buffer
- Burnout? → Take full week off, resume at 50%

## YOUR REALITY CHECK

### What's Real About This Plan
✅ Your current job (MSP, £35k)  
✅ Your gym schedule (5-6 days/week—non-negotiable)  
✅ Your work hours (9-6 PM)  
✅ Your weekend availability (4-5 hours Sat, 4-5 hours Sun)  
✅ Your goal (Data Engineer, £75k-£85k by July 2026)  
✅ Your dual-track strategy (job search + learning parallel)  
✅ Your learning resources (Bogdan, Mode Analytics, Databricks Academy, AWS)  
✅ Your certifications (real exams, real requirements)  
✅ Your timeline (9 months, achievable)  

### What's Uncertain (But Planned For)
⚠️ Will you get stepping-stone job offer? (Plan assumes yes, contingency if no)  
⚠️ Will you pass all certs on first try? (Retake buffers built in)  
⚠️ Will you land Data Engineer offer by July? (Timeline is achievable, not guaranteed)  
⚠️ What if life happens? (Contingency plans included)  

### What Will Determine Success
1. **Consistency** (showing up every weekend)
2. **Focus** (one thing at a time, no distractions)
3. **Follow-through** (finishing projects, not abandoning them)
4. **Honesty** (real check-ins, admitting when behind)
5. **Flexibility** (adjusting intelligently when needed)

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

### ❌ DON'T
- Read all 26 weeks at once (you'll get overwhelmed)
- Add new courses mid-phase (breaks focus)
- Skip recovery weeks (they're part of the strategy)
- Copy-paste code from tutorials (defeats the purpose)
- Polish projects endlessly (working > perfect)
- Expect to work weeknights + weekends (you'll burn out)
- Ignore the check-in template (accountability matters)
- Adjust the plan every week (one monthly review is enough)
- Apply to Data Engineer jobs before May 2026 (wrong time)

### ✅ DO
- Read only your current week
- Focus on one phase at a time
- Code everything yourself
- Build imperfect projects fast
- Take recovery weeks seriously
- Report honestly on Sunday evenings
- Ask for help when stuck >30 minutes
- Trust the process
- Show up consistently

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### "Should I follow MASTER_PLAN or WEEK_BY_WEEK?"
**Both. Master Plan is strategic, Week-by-Week is tactical.**
- Use Master Plan for monthly reviews and understanding the big picture
- Use Week-by-Week for daily/weekly execution
- They work together

### "What if the week-by-week plan doesn't match my life?"
**Adjust intelligently, then tell me.**
- If you have a doctor's appointment Saturday? → Move 2 hours to Sunday
- If you're sick? → Take the week lighter, adjust timeline
- If work is crazy? → Reduce to weekends only temporarily
- Just report the adjustment so I can help replanning

### "Should I do all the optional resources?"
**No. Stick to the primary ones:**
- Bogdan Python (required)
- Mode Analytics SQL (required)
- Databricks Academy (required)
- AWS official prep (required)
- Everything else: Only if time permits, don't let it slow primary work

### "What if I'm behind on a project?"
**Don't panic. You have flexibility:**
1. Extend that phase by 1-2 weeks (you have buffer)
2. Reduce project scope (focus on MVP, not perfection)
3. Continue to next phase (don't let one project block progress)
4. Tell me so we can adjust the overall timeline if needed

### "How do I know if I'm on track?"
**Check these milestones:**
- Week 4 (Dec 1): Bogdan 70%, Project 1 done
- Week 8 (Jan 5): Phase 1 + 2 complete, Project 2 done
- Week 13 (Feb 9): SQL Mastery complete + Project 2 progress
- Week 22 (Apr 19): AWS cert + Projects 4-5
- Week 26 (May 18): Capstone started, job search launched
- Week 36 (Jul 28): Capstone done, job search active

If you're at 80%+ of targets, you're on track. If <60%, let's adjust.

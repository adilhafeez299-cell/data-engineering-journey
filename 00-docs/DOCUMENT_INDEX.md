❌ Don't second-guess the timeline  
❌ Don't add courses mid-phase  
❌ Don't skip recovery weeks  
❌ Don't polish projects endlessly  
❌ Don't apply to Data Engineer jobs before May 2026  
❌ Don't work weeknights + weekends (burnout risk)

## FINAL WORDS

This plan is:
✅ Ambitious but achievable  
✅ Structured but flexible  
✅ Realistic about your time and energy  
✅ Based on verified resources  
✅ Designed for 36-week execution  

This plan is NOT:
❌ Theoretical or academic  
❌ Dependent on luck or talent  
❌ Fabricated with fake details  
❌ Impossible without perfect conditions  
❌ Something you've been overwhelmed with before  

You have ONE plan. It's solid. You have the resources. You have the timeline.

All that's left is execution.

**One weekend at a time.**

## FINAL WORDS

This plan is:
✅ Ambitious but achievable  
✅ Structured but flexible  
✅ Realistic about your time and energy  
✅ Based on verified resources  
✅ Designed for 36-week execution  

This plan is NOT:

You have ONE plan. It's solid. You have the resources. You have the timeline.

All that's left is execution.

**One weekend at a time.**

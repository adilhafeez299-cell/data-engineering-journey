## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Mission
Transform from Systems Engineer to Data Engineer through strategic two-phase approach:
- **Phase 1:** Secure Junior Software Engineer/Platform Engineer role (Jan 2026)
- **Phase 2:** Build engineering foundation on the job (18-24 months)
- **Phase 3:** Transition to Data Engineer specialization (mid-2027)
- Foundation skills learned properly with mentorship, not rushed weekend self-study

### Why This Works (Revised Strategy)
1. **Engineering Role First**: Target Junior SWE/Platform Engineer (£38-50k) by Jan 2026
   - Learn to code 40 hours/week (paid to learn)
   - Professional mentorship and code reviews
   - Proper engineering culture and best practices

2. **Build Strong Foundation**: 18-24 months in engineering role (Jan 2026 - Jul 2027)
   - Master Python/backend development through actual work
   - Learn cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, testing, Git workflows
   - Weekend study supplements with data-specific skills (SQL, Spark, data pipelines)

3. **Specialize in Data**: Mid-2027 transition to Data Engineer
   - Apply with REAL engineering experience (not just self-study)
   - Certifications and portfolio projects complement job experience
   - Target £60k-£75k (realistic for engineer with 18-24 months experience)

4. **Why Not Cloud Support**:
   - Support roles = lateral move with limited growth
   - Engineering roles = career trajectory and proper development skills
   - Better foundation for long-term data engineering career

5. **Sustainable Timeline**:
   - Not rushing to "Data Engineer" title in 9 months
   - Building genuine competence over 18-24 months
   - Higher probability of success, lower burnout risk

### What You'll Have by Mid-2027

✅ **Job Experience (Primary Asset):**
- 18-24 months as Junior Software Engineer / Platform Engineer
- Real production code experience with professional mentorship
- Code reviews, testing, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure
- Proven ability to work in engineering teams

✅ **Technical Foundation (From Job + Weekend Study):**
- **From Job:** Python/backend development, Git workflows, testing, cloud platforms, CI/CD
- **From Weekends:** SQL mastery, data pipelines, PySpark, data modeling
- Combined: Strong engineering foundation + data-specific skills

✅ **Certifications (Targeted, Not Rushed):**
- AWS Certified Developer Associate OR AWS Solutions Architect (earned during job, 2026)
- Optional: Databricks Data Engineer Associate (if time permits, 2027)
- Focus: Depth over quantity, complement job experience

✅ **Portfolio Projects (Quality Over Quantity):**
- 3-4 well-built projects showing engineering + data skills
- Project 1: Python Automation Tool (complete by Jan 2026)
- Project 2: Data Pipeline or ETL project (2026, using job skills)
- Project 3: End-to-end data project with cloud deployment (2027)
- Each project: Production-quality, well-documented, demonstrates real skills

## DUAL-TRACK STRATEGY (REVISED)

### TRACK 1: Job Search (Immediate Priority - UPDATED)
**Goal:** Secure Junior Software Engineer or Platform Engineer role by January 2026

**Target Roles (PRIORITY ORDER):**
1. **Junior Software Engineer (Backend)** ⭐⭐⭐ (Best for learning to code)
   - Python/Java/Go backend development
   - RESTful APIs, databases, testing
   - Engineering culture with mentorship
   - Salary: £38k-£48k
   - **Why:** Learn to code properly, 40hrs/week with mentorship

2. **Platform Engineer / DevOps Engineer** ⭐⭐ (Best for infrastructure)
   - Cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure/GCP)
   - CI/CD, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), IaC (Terraform)
   - Automation and scripting
   - Salary: £40k-£50k
   - **Why:** Infrastructure foundation, cloud skills, automation experience

3. **Cloud Support Engineer** ⭐ (Backup only if no engineering offers)
   - Only consider if no Junior SWE/Platform Engineer offers by February 2026
   - Uses Azure/M365/Intune expertise
   - Less reactive than MSP
   - **Why:** Lateral move with limited growth - avoid if possible

**Application Strategy:**
- **Nov-Dec 2025:**
  - Update CV for engineering roles (highlight Python learning, projects, cloud experience)
  - LinkedIn optimization for Junior SWE/Platform Engineer keywords
  - Target 20-30 companies with strong engineering culture
  - Apply to 5-10 quality roles (no mass applications)

- **Target:** Engineering offer by January 2026
- **Plan:** Stay 18-24 months, learn properly, then transition to Data Engineer
- **Flexibility:** Willing to invest time in strong engineering foundation over quick title bump

**Why Engineering Roles Over Support:**
- Engineering = career trajectory, mentorship, real development experience
- Support = lateral move, limited growth, mostly troubleshooting
- 18-24 months learning foundation > 9-month weekend sprint
- By 2027, you'll be STRONG engineer ready to specialize in data

### TRACK 2: Learning (Continuous - REVISED FOCUS)
**Goal:** Build engineering fundamentals to support Junior SWE/Platform Engineer role, then supplement with data-specific skills

**NEW APPROACH:**

---

## TIMELINE FLEXIBILITY

**Original Plan:** 9 months (Nov 2025 → July 2026)

**Updated Philosophy:** 18-24 months (Nov 2025 → mid-2026 to mid-2027)

**Why the change:**
- Better to spend 1-2 years becoming a STRONG engineer in a good role
- Then specialize in data engineering from solid foundation
- Rushing to "Data Engineer" title in 9 months = shallow skills
- Strong foundation now = better DE candidate later

**What this means:**
- Learning plan remains the same (all phases, projects, certs)
- Job search targets Junior SWE/Platform roles (not just stepping stones)
- Timeline extends if you land good engineering role
- Skills matter more than speed to title

**Your Timeline at a Glance:**

**Learning Track (Continues as Planned):**
```
Nov 2025: Python Foundations (4 weeks)
├─ W1: ✅ Complete (25%)
├─ W2: 📍 In Progress (target 50%)
├─ W3: Project 1 planning
└─ W4: Project 1 complete + recovery week

Dec 2025 onwards: Continue learning progression
├─ SQL & Data Analysis
├─ AWS & Cloud
├─ Databricks + Capstone
└─ All 6 projects + 3 certifications
```

**Job Search Track (Updated):**
```
Nov-Dec 2025: Junior SWE/Platform Engineer search
├─ W2-3: Applications + networking
├─ W4-6: Follow-ups + interviews
└─ Target: Offer by Jan 2026

Jan 2026 - Mid-2027: Engineering Role (18-24 months)
├─ Learn to code properly (40hrs/week paid)
├─ Build strong foundation
├─ Continue learning track on weekends (5-8hrs/week)
├─ Complete projects and certifications
└─ Become strong engineer with DE specialization

Mid-2027: Data Engineer Transition
├─ Apply to DE roles with 18-24mo engineering experience
├─ Strong portfolio (projects + certs + real job experience)
├─ Solid coding foundation from Junior SWE/Platform role
└─ Target: £60k-£75k DE offer
```

**Philosophy Update:**
Better to spend 18-24 months becoming a STRONG engineer, then specialize in data, than to rush into 'Data Engineer' title in 9 months with shallow foundation.

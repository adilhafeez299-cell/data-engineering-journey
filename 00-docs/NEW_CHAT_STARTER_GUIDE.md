## QUICK CONTEXT TEMPLATE (Copy This Every New Chat)

```
I'm Adil, Week 9-10 of my 18-month Software Engineering roadmap (Jan 31, 2026).

CURRENT STATUS:
- Phase: 1 (Python Fundamentals) - 58% complete
- Primary learning: Bogdan Python Course (54/92 chapters, ~38 remaining)
- Target: Complete Bogdan 100% by Week 12 (mid-Feb 2026)
- Key docs: See /00-docs/ in my data-engineering-journey repo
  - Master plan: MASTER_PLAN_18MONTH.md
  - Week-by-week: WEEK_BY_WEEK_EXECUTION_18MONTH.md

CAREER GOAL:
- Target: Python-focused Software Engineer
- Primary path: Data/Platform/Cloud Engineering
- Secondary flexibility: AI, Backend, or any Python-heavy role
- Broader goal: Well-rounded software engineer with strong Python foundation

WORKFLOW THAT WORKS FOR ME:
- When I hit confusion: Point me to specific theory/resource → I read → Continue practicing
- Don't let me spiral about "going off track" - fixing learning gaps IS the track
- I'm in Week 9-10 - struggling with new concepts is normal and expected
- Guide me to theory when needed, then let me practice by doing

MY LEARNING CONTEXT:
- Working full-time 9-6 as Systems Engineer at Atlas Technica
- Study schedule: Weekend-heavy (Sat 4-5h, Sun 4-5h), weeknights Tue/Thu (1-2h if energy permits)
- Phase 1 supplement: Automate the Boring Stuff (ATBS) for Python theory
- I maintain fitness routine 5-6x/week - this is non-negotiable for mental health
- Resources: 23 SE books purchased (shelf for later - Python Pro, System Design, Leadership, etc.)

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS:
- I'm still building fundamentals - can't write code fluently yet
- I WILL get stuck on exercises - that's part of learning
- I need theory when concepts don't click - reading isn't "going off track"
- I'm executing an 18-month marathon, not a sprint

What I need help with today: [YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION]

## CALIBRATION REMINDERS FOR CLAUDE

**When Adil spirals:**
- Remind him: Week 9-10 with 58% Bogdan is solid progress
- Point to specific doc section that shows he's on track
- Redirect to immediate next action (read X, then do Y)
- No long explanations - concise redirection

**When Adil hits a learning gap:**
- Identify the specific concept he's missing
- Point to exact resource section (ATBS Ch X, pages Y-Z)
- Tell him how long it should take (10-20 mins)
- After he reads: Help him apply it to his current task

**When Adil asks "am I off track?":**
- Check current week number (currently Week 9-10)

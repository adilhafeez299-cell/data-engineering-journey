# Philosophy and Principles

## Core Philosophy

This career transition is built on three pillars:
1. **Quality over quantity** in both learning and job applications
2. **Practical application** through project-based learning
3. **Strategic focus** on roles that match existing skills

## Learning Principles

### 1. Depth Before Breadth
- Master fundamentals before moving to advanced topics
- Complete practice exercises, don't just watch tutorials
- Build projects that demonstrate understanding

### 2. Learn by Doing
- Code every day, even if just 30 minutes
- Break complex concepts into small, testable pieces
- Document what you learn in your own words

### 3. Iterative Progress
- Small, consistent progress beats irregular bursts
- Review and reinforce previous topics regularly
- Don't be afraid to revisit basics when needed

## Job Search Principles

### Job Search Philosophy Update (December 2025)

**Original Thinking:**
Get ANY better job → Quick stepping stone → Sprint certifications → DE by July 2026

**Refined Strategy:**
Get RIGHT engineering role → Stay 1-2 years and learn properly → Strong DE candidate by mid-2026 to mid-2027

**Why the Change:**
After reviewing actual job roles and reflecting on goals:
- **Quality > Speed:** Better to build strong foundation than rush to title
- **Engineering > Support:** Junior SWE/Platform roles provide better learning than Cloud Support
- **Foundation > Shortcuts:** 1-2 years of proper engineering beats 9-month sprint
- **Career Trajectory > Salary Bump:** Right role matters more than immediate pay increase

**What This Means:**
- **Target Roles (Priority Order):**
  1. Junior Software Engineer (Backend) - Best for learning to code
  2. Platform Engineer - Best for infrastructure at scale
  3. Cloud Support Engineer - Backup only

- **Timeline:** Flexible 18-24 months instead of rigid 9 months
- **Strategy:** Stay in good engineering role 1-2 years if found
- **Success Metric:** Becoming a STRONG engineer who happens to specialize in data > getting "Data Engineer" title quickly with weak skills

### Critical Clarification: Extended Timeline ≠ Reduced Goals

**WRONG Interpretation:**
- "18-24 months = I can relax and do less"
- "I'll reduce certifications because I have more time"
- "3-4 projects is enough instead of 6"

**CORRECT Interpretation:**
- "18-24 months = I can do the SAME plan with less stress"
- "All 3 certifications PLUS 1-2 years engineering experience = stronger candidate"
- "All 6 projects spaced over 18 months = better quality, same outcome"

**The Math:**
- Core Plan: 10-13 hrs/week × 36 weeks = 360-470 hours self-study → £75k-£85k DE role
- Extended Plan: (40 hrs/week engineering job × 52 weeks) + (10-13 hrs/week self-study × 72 weeks) = 2,080 paid + 720-936 self = 2,800-3,016 total hours → SAME £75k-£85k DE role

**Extended plan = MORE experience, not LESS work.**

### What Stays Non-Negotiable

Regardless of timeline (9 months or 24 months):
- ✅ All 3 certifications (2 Databricks + AWS Data Engineer)
- ✅ All 6 projects (spaced better if extended timeline)
- ✅ 10-13 hours/week weekend study (even if working engineering job)
- ✅ £75k-£85k salary target for Data Engineer role
- ✅ Same learning phases (Python → SQL → AWS → Databricks)
- ✅ Same resources (Bogdan, Mode Analytics, Databricks Academy, AWS)

### 1. Strategic Application
- Apply to roles that match 70%+ of requirements
- Customize each application (no mass applying)
- Focus on companies with strong engineering culture
- **Prioritize engineering roles over support roles** (career trajectory)
- Target 5-10 quality applications, not 50+ mass applications

### 2. Quality Signals
- Each application should demonstrate genuine interest
- Research the company and role before applying
- Highlight transferable skills from cloud support
- **Emphasize learning ability and growth mindset**
- Show genuine interest in engineering, not just job hunting

### 3. Honest Positioning
- Be transparent about current skill level
- Emphasize learning ability and work ethic
- Focus on potential and trajectory, not just current state
- **Frame as "aspiring engineer" not "data engineer"** (for Junior SWE/Platform roles)

## Project Principles

### 1. Production-Quality Mindset
- Write clean, documented code
- Include tests and error handling
- Use version control properly

### 2. Real-World Relevance
- Build projects that solve actual problems
- Use technologies listed in job descriptions
- Demonstrate end-to-end thinking

### 3. Portfolio Value
- Each project should be showcase-ready
- Include README with clear explanation
- Show progression of complexity

---

## Time Management Principles

### 1. Protected Learning Time
- Block specific hours for focused study
- Minimize distractions during learning blocks
- Track time to ensure consistent investment

### 2. Balanced Approach
- Split time between learning and job search
- Don't let job search anxiety derail learning
- Don't let learning perfectionism delay applications

### 3. Regular Review
- Weekly review of progress and plans
- Adjust strategy based on results
- Celebrate small wins

---

## Mindset Principles

### 1. Growth Orientation
- Every challenge is a learning opportunity
- Rejections are data points, not failures
- Focus on what you can control

### 2. Realistic Optimism
- Acknowledge the challenge while staying positive
- Set achievable goals with stretch targets
- Measure progress against your own baseline

### 3. Community Engagement
- Share learnings publicly (blog, GitHub)
- Engage with data engineering communities
- Help others when possible (teaching reinforces learning)

## Decision-Making Framework

When faced with choices, ask:
1. Does this align with target roles?
2. Does this demonstrate practical skill?
3. Is this the best use of my limited time?
4. Will this help me stand out positively?

If the answer to 3+ questions is "yes", proceed. Otherwise, reconsider.

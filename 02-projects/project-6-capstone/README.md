- Addresses a real business problem
- Integrates multiple data sources
- Implements full ETL/ELT pipeline
- Includes analytics and reporting layer
- Demonstrates production-ready practices

---

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate Python, SQL, cloud, and big data skills
- Design end-to-end data architecture
- Implement production best practices
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Build portfolio-ready showcase project
- Demonstrate problem-solving and decision-making
- Practice presenting technical work

---

## Tech Stack

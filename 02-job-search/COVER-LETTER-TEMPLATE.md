## Quick Decision: Do I Need to Customize?

**Always customize if:**
- Role is a strong match (70%+ requirements)
- Company is on your target list
- It's a smaller company or startup
- The posting mentions specific projects

**Can use lighter customization if:**
- It's a large company with standard posting

**Never send without ANY customization:**
- Even for volume applications, change at minimum: company name, role title, and one specific detail

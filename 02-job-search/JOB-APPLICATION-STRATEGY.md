# Job Application Strategy

## Core Principle: Quality Over Quantity

**Target:** 3-5 high-quality applications per week, not 20 generic ones
**Focus:** Roles where you can demonstrate genuine value, not just check boxes

## CV Selection Decision Tree

### Use CV-v1 (Cloud Support Focus) When:
- Role mentions AWS heavily in requirements
- Company is cloud-native or AWS partner
- Position involves supporting data infrastructure
- Job posting emphasizes troubleshooting or operational skills
- Title includes "Cloud" or "AWS"

**Example Job Titles:**
- Junior Data Engineer (AWS focus)
- Cloud Data Engineer
- Data Support Engineer
- AWS Data Analyst

### Use CV-v2 (Platform Engineering Focus) When:
- Role is platform-oriented (DevOps, SRE, Platform)
- Heavy emphasis on infrastructure and reliability
- Job posting mentions CI/CD, monitoring, automation
- Company culture values operational excellence
- Position bridges infrastructure and data

**Example Job Titles:**
- Platform Engineer
- Data Infrastructure Engineer
- DevOps Engineer (Data focus)
- Site Reliability Engineer

### Use CV-v3 (Data Platform Focus) When:
- Role specifically mentions "data platform"
- Balance between data and infrastructure skills
- Analytics engineering positions
- Company building or scaling data platforms
- Job emphasizes both pipeline and platform work

**Example Job Titles:**
- Data Platform Engineer
- Analytics Engineer
- Data Infrastructure Engineer
- Platform Data Engineer

### Use CV-v4 (Universal) When:
- General junior data engineer position
- Requirements are broad and varied
- No specific emphasis on cloud or platform
- Startup with wide-ranging responsibilities
- You're not sure which angle to emphasize

**Example Job Titles:**
- Junior Data Engineer
- Data Engineer
- Associate Data Engineer
- Data Engineer I

## Red Flags: When NOT to Apply

### Immediate No-Go
- Requires 3+ years of specific data engineering experience
- Senior-level responsibilities despite "junior" title
- Requires advanced degree (unless you have it)
- Tech stack is completely unfamiliar with no learning time
- Company culture red flags (Glassdoor research)
- Unrealistic expectations for junior role

### Proceed with Caution
- "Nice to have" requirements you don't meet (these are OK)
- Different cloud platform (AWS experience transfers)
- Industry you're unfamiliar with (can learn)
- Remote vs. on-site preference mismatch
- Salary range below your target

### Ask Yourself
1. Could I contribute meaningfully in the first 3 months?
2. Does this align with my career direction?
3. Would I genuinely want to work here?
4. Can I demonstrate relevant skills from my projects?

If answer is "no" to 2+ questions, skip it.

## Managing Rejections

### Mindset
- Rejections are data points, not judgments
- Need 50-100 applications for 1 offer (typical)
- Each application is practice
- Focus on improving, not dwelling

### Action Items After Rejection
1. Update tracker with rejection note
2. Review application - what could improve?
3. If interviewed, request feedback (politely)
4. Move on to next application same day
5. Don't apply to same company for 6 months

### When to Adjust Strategy
- 0 responses after 20 applications: CV/portfolio issue
- Interviews but no offers after 10: Interview prep needed
- Ghosted consistently: Application quality issue
- Wrong role fit feedback: Reconsider target roles

---

## Application Tracker Usage

### Must Track
- Company name and URL
- Job title and posting URL
- Date applied
- CV version used
- Key customizations made
- Application status
- Follow-up dates
- Interview stages
- Final outcome
- Notes/lessons learned

### Weekly Review
- Count applications (meeting target?)
- Response rate (acceptable?)
- Interview conversion (improving?)
- Identify patterns in responses
- Adjust strategy based on data

## Monthly Strategy Review

### Questions to Ask
1. Am I applying to right types of roles?

3. Are my projects demonstrating the right skills?

### Adjustments to Consider
